# red-pentest
# This will be a guided penetration test of a vulnerable VM
 
 You will be asked to perform different tasks pulled from the penetration testing process, which you have been learning about, specifically, enumeration, exploitation, 
 and privilege escalation. In each task, you will be asked specific leading questions and pointed toward a particular tool or concept we have been using in our 
 exploration of vulnerable VMs.
